# Hotel Management Project

its my very first time full stack project in React and Web development World!
its build by React 18 & React Quary (Tanstack) + Supabase + React Router + Styled Components (for styling) + Toast notifications + React Recharts + react-select + react-hook-form + react-datePicker ....
Its a real World Example for internationals Hotels with Awsome feautures like booking,authentication,cabins,guests,settings,check-in-checkout...
i optimized it with memoizing to reduce extra rendering,
